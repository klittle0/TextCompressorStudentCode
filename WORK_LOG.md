| Dec 2 | 9:15-10:00am | I started thinking about the problem set with Liliana. We considered using a Trie to solve the problem, but decided that it would be very hard to pass in as part of the header. We settled on a window, like what we did for DNA, that checks all possible sequences of lengths 3, 4, and 5. I will make an array with all of the windows/sequences that appear multiple times & sort them to find the most frequent ones. These will be passed to the expand method as a header in the file. I started writing thorough pseudocode. |

This might miss some instances of repeated sequences, but it should save a ton of space in memory, so it should be worth it. I started my actual Java implementation. I got maybe halfway through my compress method, creating the dictionary. Next steps: analyzing the dictionary & writing the header. |
