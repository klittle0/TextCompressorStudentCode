| Dec 2  | 9:00-10:00am  | I started thinking about the problem set with Liliana. We considered using a Trie to solve the problem, but decided that it would be very hard to pass in as part of the header. We settled on a window, like what we did for DNA, that checks all possible sequences of lengths 3, 4, and 5. I will make an array with all of the windows/sequences that appear multiple times & sort them to find the most frequent ones. These will be passed to the expand method as a header in the file. I started writing thorough pseudocode. |
| Dec 3  |  1:50-3:00pm  |                                                                                            I continued writing my pseudocode & decided to use a buffer that takes in 60 chars at one time rather than the entire text file. This might miss some instances of repeated sequences, but it should save a ton of space in memory, so it should be worth it. I started my actual Java implementation. I got maybe halfway through my compress method, creating the dictionary. Next steps: analyzing the dictionary & writing the header. |
| Dec 3  |  5:00-5:30pm  |  I did some research on how to sort a dictionary of all of my windows and occurence counts, but I couldn't find anything that would be easy and efficient to implenment in my code. I also considered going through the dictionary and removing all windows with occurrences below 3, but even after more research, I couldn't find a way to iterate through the dictionary, index by index. Maybe I should not use a dictionary, but an array of tuples that I can index through? Would that take up more space, or around the same? |

| Dec 11 |  6:00-7:00am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I started the second attempt, writing the compression method to Sedgewick/Mr.Blick's guidance. I used 256 as the end of file code, initialized a TST, and created a while loop, referencing the algorithm activity we did in class to write pseudocode. |
| Dec 11 | 9:00-10:00am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I finished the compression method and started working on expand, referencing Sedgewick's reading and out in-class activity. I found an error in my compress method with the way I was adding values to the TST (not actual ASCII values), so I corrected that. |
| Dec 11 |  6:15-7:00pm  |                                                                                                 I finished the expand method and tried to debug both methods. For a while, I was running into an index out of bounds error, but I was able to fix it by adding if-statements into my compress method so that it could only look ahead if there was space, and so it didn't try to add more that 4096 codes. I tested my code again, and that time, it was able to compress & expand, but the expanded file comprised of only numbers. |
| Dec 11 |  7:45-8:30pm  |                                         I checked the size of my alice.bin file after compiling ym code & found that it was 46104 bits, almost 10 times smaller than it should be. I went back through my code and tried to remove some redundant variables to make it easier to debug. I also replaced my while loop with a for loop, since the while loop felt overly complicated when sliding over with an index & not using substring on text. However, these errors have made it so alice.bin compresses to be 683,128 bits now. |
| Dec 11 |  8:30-9:15pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I spent more time combing over my compress method & I still can't figure out what's wrong. I also tried to fix some bugs in my expand method, particularly in regards to the edge case. I spent time honing the if statements at the end of the method. |
