| Dec 2  | 9:00-10:00am  | I started thinking about the problem set with Liliana. We considered using a Trie to solve the problem, but decided that it would be very hard to pass in as part of the header. We settled on a window, like what we did for DNA, that checks all possible sequences of lengths 3, 4, and 5. I will make an array with all of the windows/sequences that appear multiple times & sort them to find the most frequent ones. These will be passed to the expand method as a header in the file. I started writing thorough pseudocode. |
| Dec 3  |  1:50-3:00pm  |                                                                                            I continued writing my pseudocode & decided to use a buffer that takes in 60 chars at one time rather than the entire text file. This might miss some instances of repeated sequences, but it should save a ton of space in memory, so it should be worth it. I started my actual Java implementation. I got maybe halfway through my compress method, creating the dictionary. Next steps: analyzing the dictionary & writing the header. |
| Dec 3  |  5:00-5:30pm  |  I did some research on how to sort a dictionary of all of my windows and occurence counts, but I couldn't find anything that would be easy and efficient to implenment in my code. I also considered going through the dictionary and removing all windows with occurrences below 3, but even after more research, I couldn't find a way to iterate through the dictionary, index by index. Maybe I should not use a dictionary, but an array of tuples that I can index through? Would that take up more space, or around the same? |
